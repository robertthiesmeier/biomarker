# Comparing bivariate meta-analysis and multiple imputation for systematically missing NT-proBNP values
This repo is related to the manuscript: XXXX. While we cannot share any data, the code used in this repo presents a simplified version of how we derived the results in the analysis of the paper.

## What is the context? 

## Software
Use of two software packages: mvneta (available in Stata and R). mi impute from (available currently only in Stata). We are planning to translate the package in R soon.

## Generate the data
To illustrate the code, we generate 3 simple studies.


## Bivariate MA


## Multiple imputation approach
